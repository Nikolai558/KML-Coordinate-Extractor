# KML-Coordinate-Extractor
Convert the KML file from Google Earth Pro into a Geo-Map for vERAM

## How to run:
  - Download .exe file from Releases
  - Open Command Prompt
  - CD into .exe file location
  - Type the following, Replce {} with your specific information:
    - KML-Coord-Extractor.exe {diagram name} {full .kml file path}
      - Note: At the moment this program does not check for vailid information. (i.e. File Exists, or Special or weird characters)

## Information:
  - If the KML File is located in the same location as the .exe, you do not need the full file path, just the .kml file name will suffice.
  - The output file location will be where ever the .exe file is located. 
    - This might be updated later to take in a 3 parameter.
